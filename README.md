## Code Overview
### Common Pin Definitions
All three sensor codes share the following pin configuration:
- **pH Sensor**: Connected to `A0`
- **TDS Sensor**: Connected to `A1`
- **Turbidity Sensor**: Connected to `A2`
- **Pump Relay**: Controlled via pin `7`
- **Valve 1 Relay**: Controlled via pin `8`
- **Valve 2 Relay**: Controlled via pin `9`

### Calibration Factors
- **TDS Factor**: `1.256`
- **pH Calibration**: `-1.57 * Voltage + 17.825`
- **Turbidity Calibration**: `-1120.4 * VoltageÂ² + 5742.3 * Voltage - 4352.9`

### Sensor Files
1. **`PH.ino`**:
   - Reads data from the pH sensor.
   - Converts analog voltage to pH value using the equation:
     ```c++
     pHValue = -1.57 * Voltage + 17.825;
     ```

2. **`TDS.ino`**:
   - Reads data from the TDS sensor.
   - Calculates Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) value using the average voltage and a polynomial equation:
     ```c++
     tdsValue = (133.42 * pow(Voltage, 3)
                 - 255.86 * pow(Voltage, 2)
                 + 857.39 * Voltage) * 1.256;
     ```

3. **`Turbidity.ino`**:
   - Reads data from the turbidity sensor.
   - Converts analog voltage to turbidity value (in NTU) using the equation:
     ```c++
     turbidityValue = -1120.4 * sq(Voltage) + 5742.3 * Voltage - 4352.9;
     ```

## Usage
1. Open the `.ino` file for the sensor you want to use in the Arduino IDE.
2. Follow the wiring instructions for each sensor:
   - Connect the sensor output pin to the specified analog input pin on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect other sensor pins (e.g., VCC, GND) as per the sensor's datasheet.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno.
4. Open the **Serial Monitor** in the Arduino IDE to view real-time sensor readings.
